\begin_layout Title
Safecoin: The Decentralised Network Token
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
There are many examples of tokens (coins) being an effective mechanism for
 incentivising behaviour.
 These cases demonstrate the benefits of tokens in a wide variety of settings,
 but there is evidence that they are effective within a computer networking
 environment.
 This paper attempts to explain the reasoning behind safecoin, the digital
 token of the SAFE Network, a decentralised data and communications network.
 It is anticipated that the introduction of safecoin will incentivise behaviour
 that ensures the long term health of the network for all its users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Token Economies 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of tokens to incentivise behaviour is not novel and their use in
 multiple settings prove their utility.
 For example, token economy systems have been used to influence and guide
 behaviour in animals, prison populations, the military and education

 Doll et al.
 (2013) describe the nature of a token economy:

Within a token economy, tokens are most often a neutral stimulus in the
 form of points or tangible items that are awarded to economy participants
 for target behaviours.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, tokens provide their holder with perceived economic or social
 benefit as a reward for acting out defined and desired actions.
 Bitcoin represents an excellent example of stimulating action (mining)
 through token reward.
 Its ability to eliminate double spending by harnessing the power of a distribut
ed consensus network has given rise to a plethora of new digital currencies
 and assets.
 At the time of writing, there are currently 571 currencies listed on the
 leading cryptocurrency market capitalisation website

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is the Bitcoin protocol and the additional features created
 by so called Bitcoin 2.0 technologies that are particularly interesting.
 The protocol enables additional features to be incorporated into the block
 chain (Bitcoinâ€™s immutable public ledger).
 These features include the ability for anyone to create digital assets
 or tokens that are cryptographically secured and inextricably tied to an
 ID on the network.
 These tokens can represent either ownership, or access to services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case for using tokens within a computer network is further strengthened
 by technologies that were restricted from reaching their potential in the
 absence of any incentivisation mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One such example is TOR, software that provides user anonymity by redirecting
 Internet traffic through a series of relays run by volunteers, who contribute
 their own computing resources to the TOR network.
 Current metrics from the network report that around 6500 relays are in
 operation while there are in excess of 2,000,000 directly connected users
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "3,4"

\end_inset

.
 In order that the network continues to expand, the project recognises that
 the current volunteer approach is not sufficient and incentives to run
 relays are required.
 One of the suggested solutions is TorCoin, a incentivisation mechanism
 that attempts to compensate users running relays.
 It is proposed that TorCoin will enable relays to mine for TorCoins once
 they have successfully transferred a batch of data packets across the network
 as a reward for providing bandwidth to the Tor network

\begin_layout Subsection
The SAFE Network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network, is a P2P decentralised data
 and communications network designed and built by MaidSafe.net and is currently
 in implementation phase 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "6"

\end_inset

.
 The network will compliment all existing centralised web services and data
 centres with a secure and anonymous network comprised of the spare computing
 resources of its users.
 It is anticipated that this new network will provide a more secure and
 private experience, whilst achieving higher performance as the network
 reaches critical mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Safecoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirement of users to contribute is an unmistakable part of any P2P
 network and the implementation of incentives is essential to ensure its
 health.
 The introduction of safecoin, the cryptographic token of the SAFE Network,
 is an approach designed to encourage a number of different users and contributo
rs to the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Safecoins can only exist on SAFE and it's distribution is handled entirely
 by the network on a per use basis.
 It is anticipated that 4.3 billion coins will be produced during the life
 of the network.
 Each safecoin has it's own unique identity and they are required to access
 services on the Safe Network.
 The type of services that will be available will depend on those being
 developed by third party developers.
 It is worth noting that any type of web service currently possible on the
 existing centralised Internet is possible on the SAFE Network.
 The cost for these services will be set by the service provider and it
 is anticipated that as more and more competing apps are developed that
 market forces will maintain prices at economic levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Obtaining Safecoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Safecoin can be obtained through; farming, assisting with the maintenance
 of the underlying code, creating applications or by purchasing them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Farming is a process akin to bitcoin mining, whereby users provide resource
 (storage space, CPU and bandwidth) to the network.
 When each user creates their credentials, they will set up a safecoin wallet
 via their SAFE Network client and this wallet identity will be cryptographicall
y linked to their account.
 As figure 1 demonstrates, the safecoin earning algorithm is based on a
 Sigmoid curve, in that all vaults earn, slowly at first and the rate increases
 as the farmer stores up to the network average.
 The earning rate also takes into account the rank of the vault, a process
 whereby the network scores the usefulness of each node from 0 (being the
 worst) to 1 (the best).
 The safecoin farming rate is ultimately the result of the network rate,
 a balance of the demand and supply on the network, multiplied by the vault
 rank.
 The network rate will start to level at 20% above average, thus discouraging
 massive vaults which would bring centralisation to the network's farming
 process.
 Safecoin is allocated to them by the network and is paid to the successful
 node as data is retrieved from it (GETS), as opposed to when it is stored
 (PUTS).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

	width 7cm

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The network automatically increases farming rewards as space is required
 and reduces them as space becomes abundant.
 Data is evenly distributed on the network and therefore farmers looking
 to maximise their earnings may do so by running several average performance
 nodes rather than one high specification node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proof of Resource 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Utilising a process called Proof of Resource (POR), the network is able
 to continually validate who and what is providing resource to it in a mathemati
cally verifiable way.
 The network does this by attempting to store and retrieve data chunks onto/from
 its nodes.
 The ability for a node to carry out these actions will be determined by
 a combination of its CPU speed, bandwidth availability, unused storage
 capacity and on-line time.
 The SAFE Network uses a zero knowledge proof mechanism, where the network
 does not require to know the content of any data to be checked, but must
 know the data is in fact held and held in a manner that is accurate.
 Nodes that are either unreliable or are trying to game the network, by
 removing previously provided resource, are de ranked by the network if
 the node is unable to serve a chunk of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Core Development and Building Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible for core developers to earn safecoin by fixing bugs
 and developing new features for the underlying network.
 At the time of writing, this process has not yet been finalised.
 It is possible that code bounties will be raised by the core development
 team in conjunction with the SAFE project community.
 There are a number of existing platforms that facilitate the advertisement
 and management of code bounties, such as Bountysource and Bountify 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "7,8"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People or companies building applications on the SAFE Network will also
 be able to earn safecoins.
 As they create and release new applications, they will code their SAFE
 wallet address into their application.
 Based on how much the application is used, the network will pay safecoins
 to the safecoin wallet address of the app creator.
 This provides a built in revenue stream for app developers, one that is
 directly proportional to how successful their application is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decentralised Exchanges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will also be possible to buy safecoin.
 It is anticipated that these purchases will be made from decentralised
 peer to peer exchanges that will be built by third party developers.
 These exchanges will serve as platforms, enabling a buyer and seller to
 trade directly, potentially using multi signature (3 or more private keys
 are associated with an address, a majority must sign to make the transaction
 valid) technology to manage the transaction.
 It would also be possible to have centralised exchanges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exchanges are essential to the liquidity of safecoin as they ensure that
 people unwilling or unable (as they are using a mobile device) can still
 gain access to network services.
 Additionally, exchanges will also enable those earning safecoins to convert
 them into cash or into other cryptocurrencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Price of Safecoin 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with other digital coins, the exchange or purchase price of safecoin
 will be set by the market.
 This is a price established through the combination of supply and demand.
 As this paper has already described, the number of safecoins in circulation
 will increase based on network use.
 Almost all early safecoin holders will be farmers with this supply of resource
 creating both liquidity and distribution of wealth.
 It is anticipated that almost all users will possess at least a few safecoins
 in their wallet.
 Users may trade their safecoin for services on the network, or for cash
 (or another digital currency) using an exchange.
 The ratio of safecoin being saved (left in new wallets) versus the ratio
 being issued to Farmers will produce a price point.
 This point will be the market value of safecoin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is anticipated that as the number of applications on the network grows,
 the utility of safecoin will increase, helping to drive the price of the
 coin overtime.
 This, coupled with the increase supply of safecoin, will also potentially
 increase the stability of the coin.
 Safecoins will not have a finite quantity, as after the initial 4.3 billion
 are produced, a small percentage (dependent on usage) will be recycled
 in order to incentivise the storage of new data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of resources or services it is possible to buy will not be linked
 to the exchange price.
 The amount of storage, for example, that each safecoin buys over time will
 increase, otherwise the network resources could become very expensive if
 allowed to rise in line with the exchange price.
 This is highlighted in figure 2.

\begin_layout Section
The Transaction Manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike Bitcoin, the SAFE Network does not use a block chain to manage ownership
 of coins.
 Conversely, the SAFE Networkâ€™s Transaction Managers are unchained, meaning
 that only the past and current coin owner is known.
 It is helpful to think of safecoin as digital cash in this respect, providing
 safecoin users with more anonymity than they experience with bitcoin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Transaction Manager is a persona or role carried out by the SAFE Networkâ€™s
 vaults.
 Vaults store data on a Farmer's computer and consist of a series of processes
 or roles that vary from managing the storage of data, managing other vaults
 and more importantly in this case, managing the processing and completion
 of transactions.
 The entire SAFE Network reaches decisions based on consensus of close groups
 of 32 nodes and the transaction manager is the trusted group closest to
 any given transaction identity.
 These close groups are chosen by the network based on the closeness of
 their IDs to the ID of the safecoin.
 Closeness in this respect refers to the XOR distance as opposed to geographical
 closeness

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the major problems any virtual currency or coin must overcome is
 the ability to avoid double spending.
 Within the SAFE Network, transfer of data, safecoin included, is atomic,
 using a cryptographic signature to demonstrate that the last person who
 owned the safecoin has signed the coin over to the current owner.
 When the current owner spends the coin, they ask the network (their close
 group of 32) to accept a signed message transferring ownership to the new
 owner.
 This process is highlighted in figure 3.
 The knowledge of coin ownership (each has their own unique ID) is kept
 in several close groups and each group must agree upon and reach consensus
 (28 of 32) on the transfer of ownership before the transaction is processed
 and the ownership of the coin is transferred.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Minting safecoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transaction model, described in Section 5, enables safecoin ownership
 to be transferred.
 However, it will be possible, after the SAFE Network is launched, to mint
 safecoin in a more physical and anonymous way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minting safecoin can be achieved by the network enabling the registration
 of a special transaction with the transaction managers, that facilitates
 transfer of the ownship of the coin to any user that acknowledges the transacti
on.
 The minting process effectively removes the requirement for the transaction
 validation step from the Transaction Manager.
 When Alice wants to mint safecoin, she sends a request to Transaction Managers
 with a special request to transfer the coin(s) to anyone.
 The Transaction Managers, once they have confirmed by consensus that Alice
 is the current owner, will then generate the transaction.
 Once Alice receives the transaction name from the network, she can store
 it on an external storage device, such as a usb drive, together with a
 special validation signature which has been used as a salt when generating
 the previous sent request
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function
 that hashes a password or passphrase
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This salt is used to prevent Transaction Managers themselves trying to
 acknowledge the transaction to steal the coin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Bob receives the minted safecoin and decides he would like to spend
 them, he reads the transaction name and the validation signature from the
 storage device and then sends an acknowledgement to the network.
 Once the Transaction Managers receive the acknowledgement, the pre-generated
 transaction will be updated, thus completing the transfer of ownership
 of that coin(s) from Alice to Bob.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The benefit of using safecoin in this way is a reduction in the complexity
 of the transaction by removing the acknowledgement procedure, making minted
 safecoin similar to a cash note.
 It also means that Alice, in this case, no longer needs to worry about
 keeping her private key safe as the transaction has been pre generated.
 Minted safecoin is also more anonymous, eliminating the need to store safecoins
 only in a digital wallet that can be compromised should an adversory obtain
 access to a users SAFE Network credentials.
 However, there is risk that after the transfer transaction has been registered,
 if the owner loses the external storage device containing the safecoin(s),
 anyone will be able to claim ownership.
 However, this is no greater than the risk anyone undertakes when withdrawing
 cash from a bank, convenience comes at the price of security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Economics of Safecoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike many cryptocurrencies, whose creation is not backed by anything,
 the distribution of safecoin is backed by data.
 The generation of safecoin is entirely network led and they are only created
 as the network is used and data retrieved from network nodes.
 This activity is in contrast to currencies like bitcoin, whose coin distributio
n is arbitrarily set to 10 minute blocks.
 This means that if the SAFE Network is in great demand a large volume of
 safecoins will be created, while low demand will lead to minimal coins
 being generated.
 This demand generation cycle has a desirable affect in that it should ensure
 no over supply of safecoins, which may potentially lead to a unit price
 decrease.
 This is not to say that the price of safecoin will not be volatile, the
 comparatively small coin supply (Bitcoinâ€™s market capitalisation is currently
 $5.2 billion, whereas the US Dollar has around $17 trillion (M4 definition
 - notes, coins and bank accounts) in circulation) of cryptocurrencies makes
 this inevitable.
 However, it may provide greater stability in the long term

In many respects, the underlying economics of safecoin can be directly compared
 to Cap and Trade Economics, a strategy utilised by governments in an attempt
 to limit the amount of greenhouse (GHG) emitted by private enterprises
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "17"

\end_inset

.
 In the same way that the Cap and Trade system limits the overall emissions,
 enabling companies to pay for releasing GHGs, the safecoin cap will be
 influenced by the network average resources, with safecoins being traded
 to reach the market price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, current supply of traditional FIAT currencies has become elastic,
 with central banks of many nations engaging in quantitative easing, effectively
 printing money to ensure greater supply.
 Unfortunately this can have many negative consequences as printing money
 does not solve the underlying economic problems and can potentially lead
 to increases in inflation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 These drawbacks have led some economists to start calling for a return
 to the gold standard, a situation where supply of money was linked to the
 supply of gold, known to be valuable and very difficult to counterfeit

\begin_layout Standard
With coin generation on the SAFE Network being directly linked to network
 use, the issuance of safecoins will be linked to supply and demand for
 data services.
 Data is valuable and is considered by some as becoming a commodity in its
 own right.
 The World Economic Forum has established data as an asset class 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The realisation of data having significant monetary value is also born
 out by recent valuations in technology companies, many of whom are not
 sustainable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Having a network generated digital currency inextricably linked to a valuable
 commodity, has the potential for a stable environment, one that as the
 money supply increases, has the potential to be more resistant to price
 fluctuations.

A Revenue Model for a New Internet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to incentivising user behaviour, safecoin may also provide an
 alternative revenue source for the Internet, in the shape of micro payments.
 It is possible to implement safecoin without transaction costs (although
 these could be added to aid security

) and high divisibility (coins are valued at $0.05 at the time of writing
 (Jan 2015) and have the potential to be divided up to 4.3 billion times)
 make them well suited to very low value transactions.
 Furthermore, the SAFE Networks ability to enable an unlimited number of
 transactions with confirmations at network speed equips it well for micro
 payments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Micro payments are one of many ways to replace the current methods of funding
 todayâ€™s centralised Internet, typically this is achieved through advertising.
 Large Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, earn the vast majority
 of their revenue (91% and 89% respectively) by selling adverts at their
 users

 This model has been criticised as it not only promotes increasing surveillance
 of user data, as advertisers require to know more and more about us, but
 also removes the rewards away from content creators

It would be technically feasible, using safecoin on the SAFE Network, to
 pay for films on a cost per frame basis, with the user only paying for
 what they watch.
 This amount would automatically be deducted from the viewers safecoin wallet
 as they watch.
 A similar model could also be utilised for music, or for bloggers, with
 individual articles paid for via a paywall or on a voluntary basis.
 The decision about how to structure payment for their work would reside
 with the copyright owner.
 The SAFE Network enables an optional watermarking feature that serves to
 inform the user the identity of the content creator, however, this should
 not be confused with a DRM mechanism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several examples of advanced technologies that did not reach their
 full potential as their incentives were poorly aligned.
 Tokens or coins have been used in a wide vareity of settings, including
 decentralised computer networks, to motivate, influence and guide desired
 behaviour.
 Bitcoin in particular has shown that by properly aligning incentives, the
 health of the network is sufficiently increased as miners are compensated
 for providing their hashing power to the block chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is anticipated that safecoin will provide sufficient incentives to ensure
 the long term health of the SAFE Network, encouraging end users to provide
 their resource, while enticing both application and core developers to
 assist in the continued growth of the network.
 It is hoped that by tying together supply and demand for data services,
 the SAFE Network economy will retain a natural balancing mechanism that
 increases the reward for space as it is required and reduces the reward
 when it is not.
