## MaidSafe.net announces project SAFE to the community  ##
 
Existing Internet infrastructure is increasingly unable to cope with the demands placed on it by over [2.4 billion](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm) connected people, a number that is predicted to grow to [3.6 billion](http://newsroom.cisco.com/release/1197391/) by 2017. Today's architecture, where central intermediaries (servers) store and provide access to data is expensive and inefficient. Data centres use between [1.1% and 1.5%](http://www.koomey.com/post/8323374335) of the world's electricity (growing at 60% per annum) and represent significant expenditure for data centre owners, providers and businesses, who all have to pay to host user data and maintain the infrastructure. Security of user data has proven to be nearly impossible in today's networks with almost weekly reports of ID and password thefts.
 
To overcome these challenges a fresh approach is required, a solution that removes these inordinately expensive central points of failure, data leakage and bottlenecks. By developing a fully decentralised replacement for all Internet based services, Secure Access For Everyone (SAFE) will ensure the decentralised Internet is a reality, enabling:

- Autonomous handling of structured and unstructured data types
- Private and secure communications
- Data shared at the filesystem level worldwide, no need for http, smtp, ftp etc.
- Highly encrypted and private data at rest and in transit
- The ability for people to self-authenticate onto the network and join anonymously 
- A network resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks or IP address identification
- A network that requires no administrators or human intervention of any kind
- No requirement for forward planning using infrastructure that automatically configures around its users in real-time (no data centres)
- A highly usable and free API that enables a plethora of developers to create the next wave of secure applications not currently possible with today's centralised architecture
- An underlying crypto currency called safecoin that will incentivise all actors in this ecosystem

SAFE is the culmination of 8 years of effort by MaidSafe.net and the continued and growing number of project developers. These developers will include MaidSafe.net and many other decentralised Internet application developers. Please see http://maidsafe.net for an introduction to the technology as well as https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki for access to project documentation and code. Note the business model of 1% will be removed on commencement of the funding round and the project licenses will be replaced with an even more liberal Open Source license.

The inclusion of a [crypto currency](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100064354) is not new to the maidsafe core design. It is a logical step included in the initial design many years ago (2006). Importantly, **this proposal creates no founders pool or shares** but, incentivises funders, developers, users and satisfies existing investors in MaidSafe. This allows MaidSafe to clearly show this network truly belongs to us all and in perpetuity. It is a hugely important step to ensure the network is widely used and worked on by many hundreds of developers who can see the potential for a fully secured, unowned and decentralised Internet. Funding will seed the network, expand the developer base worldwide and push the whole proposition to the wider community in a manner that is extremely clear and logical.


#### MaidSafe Brief History

Formed in February 2006 with the intent to decentralise the Internet, the  14-strong team is based in Troon, Scotland. To reach this project stage, MaidSafe has taken investment from close friends and family, as well as supporters and Angel Investors.  Further funding and supporters are required to push the platform out to the world and to incentivise network adoption. 
 
It is also worth noting that the founder allocated all of his shares in MaidSafe to an employee share scheme (around 28%) and almost 50% of the business to a registered charity. This charity is the [MaidSafe Foundation](http://www.maidsafefoundation.org/). The Foundation will be a key player in this proposal and exists to ensure fair distribution of wealth, while helping to foster education and innovation.  Based in Scotland, the laws and regulations surrounding such organisations ensure there can be no profit motive for trustees or members of the Foundation. This is an important model for managing many aspects of a decentralised project such as SAFE.

#### Project Status

At this time, MaidSafe has completed the foundation libraries and associated code. The API is being finalised in conjunction with application developers to ensure ease of use and this is being supplemented by examples and demonstrations. The network is preparing to go into wide scale testing and MaidSafe are hoping to implement this during the announcement of the funding round. At present, developers can download and run networks for test purposes.

Full public launch of the network will take place in the very near future. Earning capabilities will be added to nodes over a period of several weeks after the initial network testing is carried out and any issues and critical bugs are resolved.  MaidSafe will be hosting weekly public [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/) over this period to answer any questions and assist application developers first hand.

#### Proof Of Resource

In many cryptocurrencies and decentralised networks a proof of something is required to allow the network to validate actions or services via a mathematically verifiable mechanism. In bitcoin this is achieved by a proof of work. This is essentially a hashing technique that requires significant (and growing) computer power to achieve. This technique allows bitcoin to confirm transactions and reward "miners" with a block of coins randomly. 

The SAFE network can validate nodes and their value to the network in a very accurate and cryptographically secure manner. The SAFE project will use this to create a **proof of resource** (see Appendix) which has some significant advantages. The resource in question is a computer's ability to store data chunks, which depends on CPU speed, bandwidth, disk space and on-line time, amongst others. This allows the proof to be a useful, measurable and an immediately verifiable entity. Proof of resource is a very efficient mechanism as its cost is very minimal.

Additionally, as a fully decentralised network, the SAFE approach allows transactions to be made and confirmed at network speed (under a second in some cases). This is due to a distributed Transaction Manager as opposed to a blockchain. In the SAFE network, a transaction management system can be linked or not. Bitcoin uses a linked blockchain (the chain term) that allows traversal of all transactions from the network start. SAFE has chosen an unlinked approach to the blockchain. Each user's account information is held by the group of nodes closest to it (according to the XOR address distance). The transaction manager only holds a temporary receipt object during the transaction procedure among users. This temporary receipt can be stored permanently allowing proof of the transaction to be maintained or destroyed immediately when the transaction completed leaving no trace on the network. In addition to allowing instant transfers of coins, this mechanism also allows an escrow model (third party acts as moderator to resolve the payment dispute, refund or force to pay). This escrow mechanism is a core component of the currency.

#### Safecoin
 
For technical implementation details see the Appendix 

History has demonstrated that having the most cutting-edge technology does not in itself guarantee wide scale use.  To ensure the SAFE network is fully and efficiently utilised, a token-based scheme is proposed where all stakeholder groups have the ability to earn these tokens (safecoins) in a manner that is both fair and equitable.

Safecoin may be earned or purchased. The whole SAFE network is configured and designed to incentivise all parts of the community. The incentivisation is a critical component of a fully decentralised Internet. The MaidSafe code base is a part of this process, other application developers will add to this and be incentivised, users will be rewarded with safecoin for allowing their computer to be part of the network and funders who act as the catalyst will be able to purchase safecoin (via an intermediary MaidSafeCoin) directly, just prior to the full network launch. This will allow funds to be made available to launch the network worldwide and application developers to release free apps of significant value to us all. This project is simply the beginning of a new Internet, one that we all own and nobody controls, this is the "Internet sans frontieres!"

In essence, safecoin is a fair and transparent way of incentivising developers, backers and end users to use SAFE.  As users sell their proof of resource, they are still earning safecoin due to the fact they are continuing to provide valuable network resources.  Application developers can now use safecoin as their revenue model, enabling them to concentrate on providing real value and not worry about revenue models and streams. Funders can help to finance a network that is focussed on providing common good while achieving returns that reward their willingness to take financial risk.

It is proposed that safecoin will have a predictable cap (2<sup>32</sup>) with a value that is determined solely by the market. Safecoin will be a virtual currency with SAFE being used to complete transactions.

#### Project Proposition

Many of today's centralised systems use advertising to monetise their existence, or actually charge for resources that are in fact exponentially decreasing in value (CPU, disk space, bandwidth, etc.).  MaidSafe proposes an approach that should not only make resources cheaper, but should also provide a crypto currency (safecoin) that will increase in value, facilitating exchange both on and off the SAFE network.
 
This paper demonstrates the creation of a fixed number of coins over time 2<sup>32</sup> (~4 billion), which can be further subdivided to facilitate trading.  It will be only be possible purchase proof of resources using safecoin on the network. This approach increases reuse of the coins, further incentivising miners. This proof of resource will represent disk space, CPU and bandwidth involved in storing shards of information. These resources will increase over time, creating a much desired increasing value for safecoin holders, while delivering exponential decreases in the cost of resources. The proof of resource algorithm will over time account for additional resources, such as proof of bandwidth, proof of CPU processing, etc.


![Resources Graph](https://raw.github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/master/resources/resources_graph.png)

In essence this proposal will ensure computing resources are shared amongst all users at the lowest possible cost.  MaidSafe believes this approach will provide the most cost-effective and efficient computing platform in the world, realising the company’s vision of an Internet for everyone, free from spying, privacy erosion and data loss.

#### Incentivisation and coin distribution
 
The SAFE network is fully inclusive and enables everyone to get involved and become a part of the project, whether a supporter, end user, backer or developer.

#### End Users
 
As end users join the SAFE network anonymously, they will start a vault (a data storage and management location).  This vault will add itself automatically to the network and start providing resources. These vaults require zero setup and administration, they are a simple download and install.  The network is designed to self-manage these resources and reward earners accordingly in a random fashion (uniformly distributed across the network), thereby securing the network’s data.

The earning speed is based on the storage space contributed to and verified by the network.  For details of the calculation, please see Appendix ‘Token System on MaidSafe Network’.  Note the dev and fundraiser lines are obscured by the IP pool.


![End User Graph](https://raw.github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/master/resources/end_users.png)

If people were to try and game the system by providing earners to store data and then switch them off, they will simply remove their ability to earn.  At some time in the future it is envisaged the network will be able to detect such data and remove it from the network.  In the meantime this kind of attack is costly to the perpetrators as their earning potential is adversely affected by their actions.  This strategy also allows the network to arbitrate and manage resources mathematically and reduces the effects of the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) type deficiencies, requiring users to provide resources in an honest manner.

Unlike many currencies, the distribution of safecoin is backed by information. This information represents the world’s data and grows exponentially. Unlike gold, which only increases at circa 1.5% per annum, the quantity of safecoin will initially burgeon. This is akin to the California gold rush, where the quantity of gold grew quickly with enthusiastic miners. In safecoin this is mirrored by the network building to the stage where it is protecting all of the world’s data. During that time the mining frequency will be exponentially decreasing.

When all of the world’s data is secured, mining will naturally slow to a pace that just keeps up with the fungibility of the whole system and the increased resources under it's protection. This will be possible as people trade safecoin for network resources. These resources are initially data, but will likely grow to be bandwidth (to allow satellite and mesh networks) and processing power (for decentralised mass calculation work) amongst others. 

The number of resources will be calculated by the network dynamically and in perpetuity. The value of individual safecoin will be market determined and this is an important notion. The number of coins in circulation is network led and the individual value is market driven. As people trade safecoin for goods and services this market value will be realised.  

MaidSafe's figures forecast an estimated mining rate over time, this forecast is completely dependent on a number of assumptions including; speed of network adoption and the amount of data stored…etc. MaidSafe does not see this as an obstacle, rather a huge opportunity. Competing in today’s market using the SAFE proposition is an enormous advantage to developers (many of which are described in this paper) and to do so in an open network which is owned by no one is very compelling.

#### Funders
 
To allow distributed ownership of the network, MaidSafe will allocate 15% of the tokens on day 1.  The coins allocated are fungible, particularly in the form of resources as backers reach their required returns or simply trade the coins.  This allocation of safecoin will allow two separate entities to be rewarded:
##### 1: Current MaidSafe investors/shareholders. 
The current MaidSafe investors have invested for the past 8 years with complete faith and desire to make a difference.  These investors have been the very reason the technology is now developed and this proposal possible.  Five percent of the safecoin issue will be laid aside for these investors and as the safecoin is increasing in value, current investors will be able to swap their shareholding in MaidSafe.net for the coins.   **The coins will be held by the MaidSafe Foundation for issuance at the request of each shareholder.** The safecoin here will be allocated at the point miners are introduced onto the network.
 
This allows investors to be rewarded for their help over the years and will also allow MaidSafe equity to return to being owned completely by the Foundation.  This approach will ensure that MaidSafe as a company is not in charge of the SAFE network and shareholders are treated with the respect they deserve.  When they are allocated safecoin they can hold these as any backer will today. 
 
##### 2: Kick-start funders
A bitcoin funding round will enable everyone worldwide to seed the SAFE project.  This will enable a direct purchase of ten percent of safecoin, these will be issued immediately.  Initially this round will value the SAFE project at circa $12M, as miners begin to earn and developers release products this valuation should very quickly increase. This figure appears reasonable as investors from eight years ago invested at a $15M valuation. These kickstart funders will purchase **MaidSafeCoin**, this coin will be issued via the Master protocol suite and will be directly convertible to safecoin as soon as earners (miners) appear online. This allows immediate benefit to the project and will demonstrate the desire of all of seed funders to decentralise the Internet, enabling a plethora of new and exciting companies to emerge and provide us with true value at little cost.

Funds raised from this round will be held by the MaidSafe Foundation and will be utilised to house the MaidSafe core team and provide financial assistance for a period of three years. It is assumed that after three years, the core MaidSafe team will have grown significantly and introduced further innovations into the space. There is no founders pool and the MaidSafe developers and team are not issued any safecoin and must earn these through commits to the code base and further innovation. This is a very important aspect of this project. No team should be rewarded by safecoin who have not provided value in some respect and this is particularly important of any existing development team.

#### Developers
 
MaidSafe proposes to reward developers in 2 ways.  Firstly, safecoin can be earned by contributing bug fixes and code that are accepted into the master branch of the SAFE codebase.  Secondly, developers that create apps that do not charge end users and are of benefit to the community will also be rewarded.  The issuance mechanism for both groups will come via the MaidSafe Foundation, who will be the recipient of the coins generated when MaidSafe seed the network with several hundred nodes during final platform testing.  This seeding stage will be public and others are welcome to contribute resources.  It should be acknowledged that until the network is declared ‘ready for general use’ that the coins may be destroyed from time to time and the network restarted.  There will be no private or hidden seeding of the network and announcements will be made at a minimum via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maidsafe-development) during these events.

15% of all safecoin earned will be allocated to the developer pool.  This will ensure the developer community is highly motivated and rewarded for providing free-to-use applications and improvements to the underlying codebase that utilise safecoin as their revenue model.
 
It is proposed that code commits and third party projects be chosen by polling the MaidSafe developer mailing list and payments will be allocated from the Foundation to successful projects/code enhancements.
 
The mining speed per vault is *projected* as:

| Time | Number of coins |
| ---------------|:-----------------:|
|first day:	| 3 |
|first week: | 28 |
|first month: |	150 |
|first year: |	3600 |

The size of the seeding network is estimated to be around 10,000 vaults, that being the case it is projected that the monthly income will be around 1.5M coins and 36M in total during the first year.

Third party developers will also be incentivised outside of the token scheme.  Choosing to develop their applications and businesses on the SAFE network will, when the network reaches critical mass, enable them to outperform all incumbents, while providing privacy and security to all their users.  The network code is free to use and there are no upfront charges for API keys or developer programmes.  Developers’ customer acquisition costs will be a fraction of the levels compared to traditional architecture due to the lack of infrastructure costs.

#### SAFE seed funding round

The funding round will be operated as follows:

* A fixed number of MaidSafeCoin will be issued and purchased in this round.
* Within that period, public funds in the form of bitcoin can be sent to a bitcoin address set up by MaidSafe; this address is called the Origin address.
* Each investor will purchase MaidSafecoin in this round. This will be directly transferable to safecoin on network earner launch.
* A quantity of 429,496,729 will be purchased for an initial value of $0.03 per coin. (funding round total $12,884,901.87) 
* The corresponding amount of safecoin will then be credited into the MaidSafe account created by the network and convertible directly from MaidSafeCoin on a one to one basis.
* Any unsold MaidSafeCoin will be split 50/50 between the existing investors and the developer pool. These developer coins will be allocated to fully planned out and resourced projects initially, to encourage rapid adoption.

**After this stage is complete there will be no further funding of this sort available on the SAFE network with safecoin.**

Any funds allocated outside the funding round will be allocated to the MaidSafe Foundation and added to the decentralised application developers pool.

The incentivisation of decentralised application projects that are funded via safecoin should also ensure very active decentralised application participation into a very powerful ecosystem with a pre-prepared revenue model.  It is also thought this model will encourage a more decentralised and distributed investor pool.  This model is very much in line with MaidSafe’s core values and decentralisation in general, using logic and fairness with as few ‘magic’ numbers as possible. 

It is interesting to note this funding does not hold any safecoins for the founders; **no founders’ pool is involved.**  MaidSafe will work with funds raised and commit to continue to develop the internal library code to earn coins in the future, provided the code is accepted by the community (as per the acceptance criteria agreed on at that time by the mailing list participants and Foundation board).  It is also the founders’ belief that if MaidSafe or any other group do not continue to innovate, they should not continue to strive as businesses.  This allows the community to always be presented with the most efficient code and advancements to the system regardless of which entity makes those advances possible.

In this manner, **MaidSafe will ‘eat at the same table’ as all other developers in the SAFE network** and all application providers that will earn revenues via the safecoin model.  It is envisaged that this approach is a very fresh and healthy model with the appropriate levels of risk and reward for all stakeholders.
 
Purpose and objectives of the Foundation 

The MaidSafe Foundation will initially:

* Hold and distribute safecoin for developer pools.
* Manage issuance of MaidSafeCoin to funders and existing investors
* Hold all patents and use safecoin to pay for the upkeep and further patents for all projects (until this sphere cannot be litigated against, the MaidSafe Foundation will act as the holder of defensive patents, of which there is already a considerable worldwide portfolio, to protect the decentralised Internet).
* House the MaidSafe team in an HQ and provide funding for independent development pods, worldwide 
* Provide finances for the core team and development pods for a period of at least three years (we have already started discussions with a person in San Francisco to begin this process immediately on funding, we hope to have at least six such pods, worldwide in year one)

No further actions can be taken by the Foundation, unless the authority is requested by the community to add additional objectives to this list.

#### Foundation members in charge of safecoin

Board members will be appointed from the community via polling.  This board should be selected from as wide a catchment as possible and include 3rd party developers, core developers and members of other decentralised projects (e.g. Mastercoin, Invictus).  The board members will be continually up for election.  If the polling shows the community wish a member to be removed then the next meeting will remove that person and they should be replaced by the next in line, selected again via polls. 

This group will ensure the correctness of the coin issuance and also that every project that is applicable is included in the polling system for funding of that project.  The board can put forward their suggestions and conclusions for any funding for projects.  The assurance of developer rewards will also be continuously-monitored and managed.  This mandate will be kept as minimal as possible to prevent unfair or inaccurate decisions being made.

An early project on the network will be a decentralised digital voting system.  This system will be used to select and continually manage a member’s position on the board.
